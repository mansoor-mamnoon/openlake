# OpenLake Documentation

This directory contains design docs, architecture notes, and contributor guides
for OpenLake — a single-node open-source lakehouse system.

If you are:
- **New to OpenLake** → start with Getting Started
- **Contributing code** → read Development + Contributing
- **Understanding internals** → read Architecture

Docs are written to be concise, opinionated, and implementation-aligned.
