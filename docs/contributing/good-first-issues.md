# Good First Issues

If you're new to OpenLake, here are beginner-friendly contribution areas:

* Improve docs clarity (typos, missing steps, diagrams)
* Add small API tests (health, version endpoints as they appear)
* Add UI polish (loading state, error messages)
* Add docker-compose quality-of-life improvements (profiles, healthchecks)

As the project evolves, we will tag GitHub issues with `good first issue`.
